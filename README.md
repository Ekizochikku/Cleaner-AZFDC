# Cleaner-AZFDC

This is an application that will calculate the final damage done by a single shot or load of a weapon in the mobile game Azur Lane. Calculations are calculated through the stats given by the ship, weapons and equipment, and skills.
This calculates damage done to ships in world 1-13 (NOT PVP OR SIREN MODE).
# Important-Info
<B> Game changes will be implemented when able. </B>

Calculations are done with preset conditions:
- Ships are level 120 and stats are represented of that. If the ship has a retrofit that changes the ship type, both the pre and post retro level 120 stats will be shown.
- Danger level is reduced to the max of the given world
- All skills are at level 10 stats
- Conditions for the skills are met for most, with some needing exceptions (such as the correct weapon, weapon type, or ship type).

<B>WARNING: Take these calculations with a grain of salt. These are very close estimates (hopefully. Some may be exact) of the damage you can expect a ship to do under these conditions.</B> In regards to skills, you will have almost complete freedom to apply whatever skill and the stats that come with those skills. Do note that this will greatly skew the predicted damage.
<B>Do what you want, but if you want to get close-to-accurate data, do your skills-research and don't be silly ^.^.</B>
